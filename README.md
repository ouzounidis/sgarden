# SGarden Total

Unified SGarden project with one root dependency manifest and two app folders:

- `frontend/`
- `backend/`

Note: `frontend/package.json` and `backend/package.json` are minimal tool/runtime manifests only. Dependencies are installed and managed from the root `package.json`.

## Prerequisites

- npm

```sh
npm install
```
